# Test-driven Development in JS

This repo contains files related to my study of this [article](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/tdd-the-rite-way-53c9b46f45e3)
-- the words here are just *notes* for my personal use.

Test-driven development cycle
1. Write test
2. Run test (expect FAILURE)
3. Write code
4. Run test again (expect SUCCESS)
5. Refactor code
6. Repeat steps (until test is SUCCESSFULL)

* Sometimes called RED, GREEN REFACTOR

Testing Frameworks
* see vanillatests.js - simple vanilla JS test framework
